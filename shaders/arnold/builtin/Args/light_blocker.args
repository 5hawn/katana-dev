  Light blockers give flexibility to the Lighting TD. They can be used as an artificial method of masking light in a scene without the overhead of adding additional geometry. Used carefully, they provide a degree of artistic freedom, allowing you to define the light boundaries in non physical ways.  The LightBlocker is a light filter that specifies a primitive volume defined in the Geometry Type (box, sphere, cylinder, or plane) which when connected to a light node will block or modify the light as it passes through that volume. The blocker will only influence a light it is connected to, just like other filters (i.e., the geometry affects nothing else, including GI,  and is invisible). One, simplistic, use would be to mimic the effect of a complex lamp housing (possibly in combination with the barndoor filter) without modeling the lamp geometry. Or, you might just like to create shadows in your scene that look different to how they normally would.
